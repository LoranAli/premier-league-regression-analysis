# Premier League Regression Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a regression analysis of Premier League team performance, focusing on the key factors that drive success in the league.

## Methodology
The analysis was performed using various statistical methods, mainly linear regression, to model the relationships between team performance (measured in points) and various predictors such as:
- Goals scored
- Goals conceded
- Player statistics (e.g., shots, passes)
- Team attributes (e.g., home advantage, manager experience)

Data was collected from public sources and combined to form a comprehensive dataset. The regression model was trained and tested, ensuring proper validation to avoid overfitting.

## Results
The results of the regression analysis yielded the following key statistics:
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination):** 0.85
- **p-values:** 
  - Goals Scored: 0.001
  - Goals Conceded: 0.045
  - Player Statistics: 0.002

These results indicate a strong model fit, where higher goals scored significantly correlate with increased points in the league.

## Key Findings
- **Goals Scored**: Teams that score more goals tend to perform better in terms of points.
- **Goals Conceded**: Conceding fewer goals is essential for overall success.
- **Team and Player Statistics**: Certain player metrics have significant positive impacts on team performance.

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates that both attacking metrics (goals scored) and defensive metrics (goals conceded) are critical in understanding team performance in the Premier League. This understanding can inform strategies for team management and player acquisitions.
