# Premier League Regression Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze historical Premier League data using regression analysis to predict match outcomes and gain insights into team performances.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical data from the Premier League, including match results, player statistics, and team information. All data is sourced from publicly available databases and repositories. 

### Key features of the dataset:
- Match results
- Player statistics
- Team standings
- Game events (goals, injuries, cards)

## Methodology
The analysis employs various regression techniques, including linear regression and logistic regression, to model the relationship between team performance metrics and match outcomes. 

### Steps:
1. Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates and handling missing values.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on existing data.
3. Model Selection: Evaluating different regression models.
4. Validation: Using cross-validation techniques to assess model performance.

## Results
The analysis produced several models with varying degrees of accuracy. Detailed results include:
- Model performance metrics
- Visualizations of predicted vs actual outcomes

## Key Insights
- Insights gained from the analysis highlight the impact of team strategies on match outcomes.
- Key player performances can significantly influence game results.

## Business Interpretation
Understanding the results of this analysis can help teams and managers make data-driven decisions regarding player selection, training focus, and tactical approaches. 

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **data/**: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling.
- **src/**: Source code for data processing and modeling.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of Premier League dynamics and offers actionable insights for teams and analysts.
